## Primary Shell

The user uses `nushell` as their primary shell. You have access to bash for tool execution.

## Autoloading

- Autoloading is managed through nushell itself and is **working correctly**
- Nushell autoloads all `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/autoload/*.nu` files during its boot process
- **DO NOT** attempt to "fix" autoloading
- **DO NOT** waste time investigating how files in the `autoload` directory are loaded
- Other files autoloaded by nushell:
  - `config.nu`
  - `login.nu` (only if session has been set as a login session)
  - `env.nu`
